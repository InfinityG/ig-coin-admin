igcoin-admin
============

A gateway application built in AngularJS, used to demonstrate the redemption and assignment of digital "crypto-rewards" to users. 

The application uses a Sqlite backend to record user registrations and transaction records. It communicates with the [ig-coin-api](https://github.com/InfinityG/ig-coin-api) RESTful API to manage reward assignment and redemption on the Ripple network.
